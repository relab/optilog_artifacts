### OptiLog Artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts accompanying the paper titled **"OptiLog: Assigning Roles in Byzantine Consensus"**.  
OptiLog offers a comprehensive framework for recording experimental measurements and utilizing them to compute optimized system configurations.
This repository contains three primary artifacts utilized in the evaluation of OptiLog.

In addition to the contents of this repository, our evaluation also relies on artifacts from the following public repositories:
- [HotStuff](https://github.com/relab/hotstuff)
- [OptiAware](https://github.com/bergerch/opti-aware)

For the final artifact submission, these two repositories have been incorporated into this repository to ensure completeness and ease of use. 

### Overview
Each of the directories contains the README to explain the usage of the artifact.

- Optitree contains the code and scripts required to perform the experiments described in figure 9 and 12. 

- fig10_config contains the configuration file required to perform the experiments described in figure 10.

- overhead contains the code to conduct the experiement described in figure 13.

- wriggle contains the code to perform the experiement explained in figure 11.
