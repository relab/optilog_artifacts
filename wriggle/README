To run the experiment described in figure 11, change hotstuff/backend/server.go line 75, to change the wriggle room. 
Use the 21 node configuration from experiment 10 to run this experiment.
Based on the number of faulty intermediate nodes, add those node ids to `FaultyNodes` in `hotstuff.go`. 
The intermediate tree nodes can be looked up in the cue configuration file. 
For example if `[5,19,1,10]` are intermediate nodes for tree of size 21, if we need two faulty nodes, add any two of them to the `FaultyNodes` list.
Do not forget to recompile after every change to the code.
Use `throughput_avg.py` and `latency_avg.py` from fig10_config on the output directory to compute the throughput and latency of the experiment.
